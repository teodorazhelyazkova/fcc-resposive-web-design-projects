  <p id="tribute-info"><strong>BTS</strong> (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the <strong>Bangtan Boys</strong>, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet — consisting of members <strong>Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook</strong> — co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.</p>
